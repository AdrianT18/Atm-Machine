## The idea of this project was to make a ATM machine using Mysql ##

During my summer break I have decided to make a small ATM project to expand my Java skills and make the best use of my time. While making this project I have ran
into a lot of silly mistakes but at the end I have learnt a lot of valuable lessons and how to be a better programmer. This project has taught me how to use javaFx,
MySql, JDBC API, GitHub and most importantly it has taught me how to become a better programmer. :relaxed:

In the mean time I started learning web development so that I can create a online website and a registration feature. :books:

 ### The requirements that I have set for this project are as follows:  ###

* Register - allows the user to register an account and update it to the DB :x:
* Quick withdrawal - The balance will automatically be deducted from their balance in the DB :white_check_mark:
* Transfer money - Their balance will be deducted with the amount they sent and the receiver balance updated :white_check_mark:
* Other services :
    - Change Pin - changes the pin in the DB  :white_check_mark:
    - Report card lost / stolen - blocks the use of this card meaning that the details are null in the db :white_check_mark:
    - Update details -  can update the users personal details :white_check_mark:
    - Delete account - deletes the account from the DB :white_check_mark:
* Cash transactions - Shows a report of all the activity that has occured ( a statement ) :white_check_mark:
* Balance :white_check_mark:

### To do list ###
- [x]  Allow the user to register and go to their online banking website.
- [ ]  Fix cash transaction requirement. As of now it only shows the previous transaction and not the whole history :disappointed:
- [x]  Add a balance scene where it shows the current users balance.

### Technologies used ###
